 Facespace!

## Goal

Create a site Facebook look alike called Facespace! using React, routing, Node and CSS along the way.



### The Frontend

1. Open a terminal in VS Code
2. Type `cd frontend`
3. Type `yarn install`

Use `yarn dev:frontend` to start the frontend dev environment.

### The Backend

1. Open _another_ terminal in VS Code
2. Type `cd backend`
3. Type `yarn install`

Use `yarn dev:backend` to start the backend dev environment.

## Screenshots

### Homepage

<img src="./_screenshots/homepage_3.png" />

### The Profile Page

<img src="./_screenshots/profile_3.png" />

### The Sign in page

<img src="./_screenshots/signin_2.png" />

### A link to the signin page in the header

We should have a link to the signin page in the header.

<img src="./_screenshots/signin_button.png" />

When the user is signed in, the "sign in" link should be replaced by a greeting and the user's name.

While you're in the header, it would be good to turn the title into a link to the homepage.

### Faces on the homepage

- Faces on the homepage should link to that person's profile page.
- Let's also add a little UX tweak on hover. Give the image some sort of effect on hover.

### My Friends!

When a user is signed in and looking at the homepage, it would be great if there were some visual indication as to who their friends are in the grid of faces. My example is a ribbon on the image, but feel free to do whatever you like.
